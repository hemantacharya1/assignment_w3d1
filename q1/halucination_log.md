# Hallucination Log - Math Tutor LLM Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies mathematical errors, hallucinations, and reasoning issues found in the LLM responses across different prompt engineering strategies.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Square Root Conceptual Error
**Prompt Style:** Zero-Shot  
**Input:** "What is the square root of 144?"  
**Issue:** Incomplete explanation of square root concept  

**Description:** While the model correctly identifies that √144 = 12, it provides an overly complex explanation involving prime factorization that may confuse Class 6-10 students. The response states "square roots are typically considered as non-negative" but then unnecessarily discusses negative roots, which could create confusion for the target audience.

### 2. Overcomplication in Few-Shot Response
**Prompt Style:** Few-Shot  
**Input:** "What is the square root of 144?"  
**Issue:** Misleading statement about square root definition  

**Description:** The response incorrectly states "the square root of a positive number is always positive" in the thinking process, which is imprecise. While the principal square root is positive, the complete solution to x² = 144 includes both +12 and -12. However, the final answer correctly identifies 12 as the principal square root.

### 3. Inconsistent Domain Restriction Handling
**Prompt Style:** Both Zero-Shot and Few-Shot  
**Input:** "Simplify: (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)"  
**Issue:** Insufficient emphasis on domain restrictions  

**Description:** Both responses correctly identify that x ≠ 3 but don't adequately emphasize this restriction in the final answer. For educational purposes, students should be explicitly reminded that the simplified form x + 3 is valid only when x ≠ 3.

### 4. Verification Arithmetic Error (Minor)
**Prompt Style:** Few-Shot  
**Input:** "Solve: (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0"  
**Issue:** Minor calculation inconsistency in thinking process  

**Description:** In the thinking section, the model calculates (-3/2 - 5) as (-11/2) but doesn't show this step clearly in the verification. While the final answer is correct, the intermediate step could be clearer for educational purposes.

## Summary
- **Total Issues Identified:** 4
- **Critical Mathematical Errors:** 0
- **Conceptual/Pedagogical Issues:** 3
- **Minor Presentation Issues:** 1

The responses generally maintain mathematical accuracy but show some pedagogical concerns regarding explanation clarity and completeness for the target student audience (Class 6-10).
