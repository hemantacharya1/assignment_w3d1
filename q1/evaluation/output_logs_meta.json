    "input": "Solve: (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a product of two expressions equal to zero, you can use the zero product property, which says that if the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero. So, I can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.\n\nStarting with the first factor, (2x + 3) = 0. To solve this, I need to isolate x. Let me subtract 3 from both sides: 2x + 3 - 3 = 0 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = -3. Then divide both sides by 2: x = -3/2. \n\nNext, the second factor is (x - 5) = 0. To solve this, I just need to add 5 to both sides: x - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5, which simplifies to x = 5. \n\nSo, the solutions are x = -3/2 and x = 5. Let me check if these are correct. Plugging x = -3/2 back into the original equation: (2*(-3/2) + 3)(-3/2 - 5) = (-3 + 3)(-3/2 - 5) = 0*(-3/2 - 5) = 0. That works. Plugging x = 5: (2*5 + 3)(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)(0) = 13*0 = 0. Perfect, that also works. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps again. The zero product property was applied correctly. Each linear factor equals zero, leading to the solutions. I don't think there are any mistakes here. So the answer is x = -3/2 and x = 5. \n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe checking if the problem had any restrictions or special cases, but since it's a quadratic equation, there are two real solutions. Yep, so everything seems to check out. The problem is clear, so I can proceed to explain the steps and solve it.\n</think>\n\nYes, the problem is clearly defined and solvable. \n\n**Step 1:**  \nUse the zero product property. When a product equals zero, at least one factor must be zero.  \n- Set $2x + 3 = 0$:  \n  $$\n  2x + 3 = 0 \\implies 2x = -3 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{2}\n  $$\n- Set $x - 5 = 0$:  \n  $$\n  x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5\n  $$\n\n**Step 2:**  \nVerify the solutions by substituting back into the original equation:  \n- For $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$:  \n  $$\n  (2 \\cdot -\\frac{3}{2} + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = (-3 + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n  $$\n- For $x = 5$:  \n  $$\n  (2 \\cdot 5 + 3)(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)(0) = 13 \\cdot 0 = 0\n  $$\n\nBoth solutions satisfy the equation.  \n\n**Final Answer:** The solutions are $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ and $x = 5$.  \n\n**Reflection:** The problem was solved step by step using the zero product property, and the solutions were verified. No further clarification is needed."

    "input": "Find the value of x: 3x + 2 = 17",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the value of x in the equation 3x plus 2 equals 17. Hmm, first, I need to check if this problem is clearly defined and solvable. Well, it seems straightforward. The equation is a linear equation, so there should be a unique solution. Let me start by solving it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is 3x + 2 = 17. To do that, I should subtract 2 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left. So, if I subtract 2 from 17, I get 3x = 17 - 2. Let me calculate that: 17 minus 2 is 15. So now the equation is 3x = 15.\n\nNext, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 3. That should give me x by itself. Dividing 15 by 3 gives me 5. So, x equals 5. Let me check my work to make sure. If I plug 5 back into the original equation, 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 equals 17. Yep, that matches the right side of the equation. So, the solution seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Starting with 3x + 2 = 17. Subtract 2: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5. Yep, that's correct. I don't think I missed anything here. The problem is simple, so the answer should be 5. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nBefore solving, I check if the problem is clearly defined and solvable. The equation 3x + 2 = 17 is a linear equation with a unique solution, so the problem is clearly defined and solvable.  \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**  \n1. Start with the equation:  \n   $ 3x + 2 = 17 $.  \n2. Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with $ x $:  \n   $ 3x = 17 - 2 $.  \n3. Simplify the right side:  \n   $ 3x = 15 $.  \n4. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for $ x $:  \n   $ x = \\frac{15}{3} = 5 $.  \n\n**Final Answer:** $ x = 5 $.  \n\nThe problem is clearly defined and solvable."

    "input": "What is the square root of 144?",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so the question is asking, \"What is the square root of 144?\" Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the problem is clearly defined and solvable. The problem is straightforward: find the square root of 144. But wait, maybe there's something else? Let me recall that square roots can sometimes have multiple values, but in this case, since we're talking about the square root of a number, it's usually referring to the principal (non-negative) square root. But let me confirm.\n\nThe square root of a positive number is a positive number. So, the square root of 144 is a positive number. Let me calculate that. Well, 12 times 12 is 144, so the square root of 144 is 12. But maybe the question is expecting me to explain the steps without just giving the answer? Let me check the instructions again.\n\nThe user says to solve the problem step by step and explain each part if it's clear. So, I need to explain each step. Let me write down the steps.\n\nStep 1: Recognize that the problem is to find the square root of 144.\n\nStep 2: Understand that square roots can be calculated as the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 144.\n\nStep 3: Since 12 squared is 144, the square root is 12.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is in another context? Like, could there be a trick here? For example, if it's a decimal or something else? But 144 is a perfect square, so there's no decimal. So, the answer should be 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects a different approach. For example, factoring 144 into prime factors. Let's see: 144 divided by 2 is 72, divided by 2 again is 36, again by 2 is 18, again by 2 is 9. Then 9 is 3 squared. So, 144 is 2^4 * 3^2. Therefore, the square root would be (2^4 * 3^2)^(1/2) = 2^2 * 3^(1) = 4 * 3 = 12. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods give me 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. But let me make sure there's no ambiguity. The problem is straightforward, so it should be solvable. Therefore, I should explain the steps and give the answer.\n</think>\n\nIs this problem clearly defined and solvable?  \nYes, it is. The question asks for the square root of 144, which is a straightforward mathematical operation. Since 144 is a perfect square, its square root is a positive integer.  \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  \n1. Recognize that the problem is to find the square root of 144.  \n2. Understand that the square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.  \n3. Since $12 \\times 12 = 144$, the square root of 144 is 12.  \n\n**Answer:** The square root of 144 is $12$."

    "input": "Simplify: (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the expression (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when you have a polynomial divided by another polynomial, especially when the denominator has a factor that's part of the numerator, you can factor the numerator and then cancel out the common terms.\n\nLooking at the numerator, x\u00b2 - 9, I notice it's a difference of squares. The formula for difference of squares is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So applying that here, x\u00b2 - 9 should factor into (x - 3)(x + 3). Let me check that: (x - 3)(x + 3) = x\u00b2 + 3x - 3x - 9 = x\u00b2 - 9. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nNow, the original expression is (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). If I substitute the factored form, it becomes (x - 3)(x + 3)/(x - 3). So the (x - 3) terms cancel out, right? As long as x \u2260 3, because if x were 3, the denominator would be zero, which is undefined. So the simplified expression would be x + 3, provided x \u2260 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other possibility. The original problem says to simplify, so even if there's a restriction, like x \u2260 3, we should mention that. But maybe the problem assumes x is not equal to 3, so we can proceed.\n\nSo the simplified form is x + 3, with the note that x cannot be 3. But the problem says to simplify, so maybe just state that and the simplified expression.\n\nI think that's it. Let me recap: factor numerator as difference of squares, cancel out (x - 3), resulting in x + 3. No other steps needed here. The problem was clear, so solve and explain.\n</think>\n\nBefore solving, the problem is clearly defined and solvable. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Factor the numerator**: The expression (x\u00b2 - 9) is a difference of squares, which factors into (x - 3)(x + 3).  \n2. **Cancel the common factor**: The denominator (x - 3) matches the factor in the numerator, so we cancel it out, resulting in $ x + 3 $.  \n3. **Note the domain restriction**: The original expression is undefined when $ x = 3 $, so we must specify this restriction to avoid division by zero.\n\n**Simplified Expression**: $ x + 3 $, with the note that $ x \\neq 3 $.  \n\n**Final Answer**: $ \\boxed{x + 3} $"

    "input": "Solve: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that quadratic equations can be factored if they are easy to split. Maybe I can look for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the x term).\n\nLet me list the factors of 6: 1 and 6, 2 and 3. Adding 2 and 3 gives me 5, which matches the middle term. So, that means the equation can be factored as (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. \n\nNow, applying the zero product property, if the product of two factors is zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. So, either x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0. Solving these, x = -2 or x = -3. \n\nWait, but let me check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I substitute x = -2 back into the original equation: (-2)\u00b2 + 5*(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0. Yes, that works. Similarly, substituting x = -3: (-3)\u00b2 + 5*(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0. Perfect, both solutions check out. \n\nSo, the solutions are x = -2 and x = -3. The problem was clear and solvable, so I should explain each step and then present the answers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is clearly defined and solvable. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Factor the quadratic equation**:  \n   The equation $x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0$ can be factored as $(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0$.  \n\n2. **Apply the zero product property**:  \n   If the product of two factors is zero, at least one factor must be zero.  \n   So, either:  \n   - $x + 2 = 0$ \u2192 $x = -2$  \n   - $x + 3 = 0$ \u2192 $x = -3$.\n\n3. **Verify the solutions**:  \n   Substituting both values back into the original equation confirms they satisfy the equation.  \n\n**Final Answer**: The solutions are $x = -2$ and $x = -3$.  \n\nIf the problem had more variables or additional constraints, further clarification would be needed."
