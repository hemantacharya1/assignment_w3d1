    "input": "Solve: (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a product of two binomials equal to zero, you can set each factor equal to zero separately. That's the zero-product property. So, I should split the equation into two parts: (2x + 3) = 0 and (x - 5) = 0. Then solve each equation individually and write the solutions.\n\nStarting with the first factor: (2x + 3) = 0. To solve for x, I need to isolate x. Let me subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the 3. So, 2x + 3 - 3 = 0 - 3, which simplifies to 2x = -3. Then, divide both sides by 2 to get x = -3/2. Wait, so x equals -1.5?\n\nNow the second factor: (x - 5) = 0. To solve this, I can add 5 to both sides to get x - 5 + 5 = 0 + 5, which simplifies to x = 5. \n\nSo, the solutions are x = -3/2 and x = 5. Let me check if that's correct. Plugging x = -3/2 back into the original equation: (2*(-3/2) + 3)*( (-3/2) - 5 ) = ( -3 + 3 )*( -3/2 - 5 ) = (0)*(...). That works, so x = -3/2 is correct. Then plugging x = 5: (2*5 + 3)*(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)*(0) = 13*0 = 0. Perfect, that's also correct. \n\nWait, but in the example given, they had x = -3 or x = 2. So here, the answer is two solutions. I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. \n\nFirst equation: 2x = -3 => x = -3/2. Yes, that's right. Second equation: x = 5. Correct. So the final answer is x = -3/2 or x = 5. \n\nI think that's all. No mistakes in the steps. So the solution is two values.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nStep 1: Apply the zero-product property: either (2x + 3) = 0 or (x - 5) = 0  \nStep 2: Solve each equation:\n\n- For (2x + 3) = 0:  \n  Subtract 3 from both sides: $2x = -3$  \n  Divide by 2: $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$  \n\n- For (x - 5) = 0:  \n  Add 5 to both sides: $x = 5$  \n\nStep 3: Final Answer: $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ or $x = 5$  \n\n**Verification:**  \nSubstituting $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ into the original equation:  \n$$\n(2 \\cdot -\\frac{3}{2} + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = ( -3 + 3 )( -\\frac{3}{2} - 5 ) = 0 \\cdot (-\\frac{11}{2}) = 0\n$$  \nSubstituting $x = 5$:  \n$$\n(2 \\cdot 5 + 3)(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)(0) = 13 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$  \n\nBoth values satisfy the equation, confirming the solution.  \n\nFinal Answer: $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$ or $x = 5$."

    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation 3x + 2 = 17. Let me think about how to approach this. The problem is straightforward, but I should break it down step by step to make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, the equation is 3x plus 2 equals 17. The goal is to find the value of x. Since it's an equation with one variable, I need to isolate x on one side. \n\nLet me start by writing down the equation again to make sure I have it right: 3x + 2 = 17. Alright, so the first step is to get rid of that 2 on the left side. How do I do that? Well, if I subtract 2 from both sides, that should help. Let me try that.\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides: 3x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2. Simplifying both sides, the +2 and -2 on the left cancel each other out, so I have 3x = 15. That's step 1. Now, I need to solve for x. The equation is 3x equals 15, so I should divide both sides by 3 to get x by itself. \n\nDividing both sides by 3: (3x)/3 = 15/3. Simplifying, x equals 5. So the solution is x = 5. Let me check if that makes sense by plugging it back into the original equation. \n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 2 = 17. If x is 5, then 3*5 is 15, plus 2 gives 17, which matches the right side. Perfect, that works out. \n\nWait, but in the example given, they used the zero-product property, which is similar to factoring. Here, instead of factoring, we use the inverse operation. So, both steps are similar, just applying the inverse operations. \n\nI think that's it. There's no need to do anything else. The answer should be x equals 5. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 3 times 5 is indeed 15, plus 2 is 17. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 5.\n</think>\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Start with the equation: $3x + 2 = 17$\n\nStep 2: Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with $x$:  \n$$3x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2$$  \n$$3x = 15$$\n\nStep 3: Divide both sides by 3 to solve for $x$:  \n$$\\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{15}{3}$$  \n$$x = 5$$\n\nFinal Answer: $x = 5$"

    "input": "What is the square root of 144?",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to solve this problem. The question is asking for the square root of 144. Hmm, I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, in this case, I need to find a number that when squared equals 144.\n\nFirst, let me think about what numbers when multiplied by themselves give 144. Let me try some numbers. Let's start with 12, because 12*12 is 144. Wait, 12 squared is 144, right? So that's one possibility. But maybe there's another number? Wait, actually, 144 is a perfect square, so the square root should be a whole number. So maybe the answer is 12. Let me check again. 12*12 is definitely 144. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another number. For example, 10*10 is 100, which isn't 144. 11*11 is 121, so that's too low. So yeah, 12 is the correct square root. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there isn't a different approach. Maybe using the zero-product property? No, that's for equations like x + 3 = 0. The square root isn't an equation, so that method might not apply here. Instead, I just look for the number that when squared is 144. Since 12 is a whole number, that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, I could use the fact that the square root is a positive number, so 12 is the principal square root. But sometimes problems might expect both positive and negative roots, but in this case, since 144 is positive, the square root is positive. So yeah, the answer should be 12.\n\nLet me recap. The problem is to find the square root of 144. The square root is a positive number because the square root of a positive number is always positive. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\nThe square root of 144 is a positive number, as the square of a positive number is always positive. \n\nStep 1: Recognize that $\\sqrt{144}$ is a positive number.  \nStep 2: Find that $12 \\times 12 = 144$.  \nStep 3: Therefore, the square root of 144 is 12.  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\sqrt{144} = 12$"

    "input": "Simplify: (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to simplify the expression (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). Hmm, first, I remember that when you have a polynomial divided by another polynomial, you can factor the numerator if possible. Let me check if (x\u00b2 - 9) can be factored.\n\nWait, x\u00b2 - 9... that's a difference of squares, right? Because a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So, x\u00b2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3). Oh, so the numerator is (x - 3)(x + 3). Then, the entire expression becomes [(x - 3)(x + 3)] / (x - 3). \n\nNow, I can cancel out the common factor (x - 3) from the numerator and the denominator. But wait, I need to make sure that x \u2260 3, because if x were 3, the denominator would be zero, which makes the original expression undefined. So, we can safely cancel (x - 3) as long as x \u2260 3.\n\nSo, simplifying, we get (x + 3). So, the simplified expression is x + 3. Let me double-check that. If I plug in x = 2, original expression is (4 - 9)/(2 - 3) = (-5)/(-1) = 5, which matches the simplified expression. If I plug in x = -3, original expression becomes ((9 - 9)/(-3 - 3)) = (0)/(-6) = 0, which also works. So yes, the simplification seems correct.\n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure there are no other steps. The problem says to simplify, so factoring and canceling the common term is the main step. No need for further operations. So the final answer should be x + 3.\n</think>\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: Recognize the numerator as a difference of squares: $ x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3) $.  \nStep 2: Simplify the expression by canceling the common factor $ (x - 3) $ from the numerator and the denominator, provided $ x \\neq 3 $:  \n$$\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3} = x + 3.\n$$  \nFinal Answer: $ x + 3 $"

    "input": "Solve: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem. The equation given is x squared plus 5x plus 6 equals zero. So, first, I need to figure out how to approach this. It looks like a quadratic equation, right? The standard form is ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, a is 1, b is 5, and c is 6. \n\nHmm, so maybe I can factor this equation. Let me think. To factor a quadratic, I need two numbers that multiply to c (which is 6) and add up to b (which is 5). Let me list the factors of 6. The pairs are (1,6), (2,3). Adding 1 and 6 gives 7, which isn't 5. Adding 2 and 3 gives 5, which matches. So that works!\n\nSo, if I can factor the quadratic as (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0, then I can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. \n\nStep 1: Factor the equation. So, (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. \n\nStep 2: Set each factor equal to zero. \n\nFor (x + 2) = 0, subtract 2 from both sides: x = -2. \n\nFor (x + 3) = 0, subtract 3 from both sides: x = -3. \n\nWait, so the solutions are x = -2 and x = -3? Let me check if that's correct by plugging them back into the original equation. \n\nFirst, x = -2: (-2)^2 + 5*(-2) + 6 = 4 -10 +6 = 0. Correct. \n\nSecond, x = -3: (-3)^2 +5*(-3) +6 = 9 -15 +6 = 0. Also correct. \n\nSo, the solutions are indeed x = -2 and x = -3. \n\nBut wait, in the example given, they used the zero-product property, which is the same method here. So, the steps should be similar. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can also solve this equation by using the quadratic formula, just to verify. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). \n\nHere, a = 1, b = 5, c = 6. Plugging in, we get x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2 = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1)] / 2 = [-5 \u00b1 1]/2. \n\nSo, the two solutions are (-5 + 1)/2 = -4/2 = -2, and (-5 -1)/2 = -6/2 = -3. Yep, same answers. So that's a good check. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is x = -2 or x = -3. \n\nI think that's all. The steps are straightforward once I factor the equation, then solve each factor separately. Both methods confirm the solutions. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solutions are \\boxed{-2} and \\boxed{-3}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation $ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $, we begin by recognizing that this is a quadratic equation in standard form. The goal is to find the values of $ x $ that satisfy the equation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Quadratic Expression\n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3, since:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 3 = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2 + 3 = 5\n$$\n\nUsing this, we can factor the quadratic:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Zero-Product Property\n\nWe set each factor equal to zero:\n\n$$\n(x + 2) = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (x + 3) = 0\n$$\n\nSolving these:\n\n- For $ x + 2 = 0 $: $ x = -2 $\n- For $ x + 3 = 0 $: $ x = -3 $\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThe solutions to the equation are:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{-2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boxed{-3}\n$$"
