    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the equation (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0. Hmm, so this is a quadratic equation, right? But maybe I can simplify it first before trying to solve it. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So maybe I can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x. That sounds like the method I should use here.\n\nStarting with the first factor: 2x + 3 = 0. To solve for x, I can subtract 3 from both sides. That would give me 2x = -3. Then divide both sides by 2. So x = -3/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check. Yes, because multiplying 2 by -3/2 gives me 2*(-1.5) = -3, which matches the original equation. Okay, so that's one solution.\n\nNow the second factor: x - 5 = 0. To solve for x, I can add 5 to both sides. That gives me x = 5. Let me make sure. If I plug x = 5 back into the original equation, does it work? Let's see: (2*5 + 3)*(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)*(0) = 13*0 = 0. Perfect, that's correct. So both solutions are valid.\n\nWait, but maybe I should write them down clearly. So the solutions are x = -3/2 and x = 5. But let me double-check if there are any other steps I need to consider. Since it's a quadratic equation, there should be two solutions, right? And since one of the factors was already solved, the other one is straightforward. I think that's all.\n\nLet me expand the original equation just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Expanding (2x + 3)(x - 5) gives me 2x*x + 2x*(-5) + 3*x + 3*(-5). That's 2x\u00b2 - 10x + 3x - 15. Combining like terms: 2x\u00b2 - 7x - 15. Wait, but if I set this equal to zero, I get 2x\u00b2 - 7x - 15 = 0. Let me check if this quadratic equation has the same roots as before. The roots are x = -3/2 and x = 5. Let me plug in x = -3/2 into the expanded equation. 2*(-3/2)^2 - 7*(-3/2) -15. Calculating each term: (-3/2)^2 is 9/4, so 2*(9/4) is 9/2. Then subtract 7*(-3/2) which is 21/2, so 9/2 + 21/2 = 30/2 = 15. Then subtract 15: 15 - 15 = 0. Correct. And for x = 5, 2*(25) - 7*(5) -15 = 50 - 35 -15 = 0. Perfect, again zero. So both solutions check out.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. The key was to factor the equation and set each factor equal to zero, then solve each equation separately. Then verifying by substitution, which confirms the solutions are correct. I think that's all there is to it. No other steps needed. So the final answer should be x = -3/2 and x = 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation $(2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0$, we can use the **zero product property**, which states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of those factors must be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Set each factor equal to zero\n\nWe are given a product of two expressions equal to zero:\n\n$$\n(2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0\n$$\n\nSo, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\n1. $2x + 3 = 0$\n2. $x - 5 = 0$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solve for $x$\n\n#### Case 1: $2x + 3 = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$$\n2x = -3 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = -\\frac{3}{2}\n$$\n\n#### Case 2: $x - 5 = 0$\n\nSolving for $x$:\n\n$$\nx = 5\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solutions\n\nWe substitute both values back into the original equation to ensure they work:\n\n- For $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$:  \n  $$(2(-\\frac{3}{2}) + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = ( -3 + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = 0 \\cdot ( -\\frac{13}{2}) = 0$$\n\n- For $x = 5$:  \n  $$(2(5) + 3)(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)(0) = 13 \\cdot 0 = 0$$\n\nBoth values satisfy the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } x = 5}\n$$"

    "input": "Find the value of x: 3x + 2 = 17",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve the equation 3x plus 2 equals 17. Hmm, so the problem is 3x + 2 = 17. Alright, first step is probably to isolate x. How do I do that? Well, I remember from algebra that I need to get x by itself on one side. So, I should subtract 2 from both sides to get rid of that 2 on the right. Let me try that. \n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides would give me 3x = 17 - 2. Let me calculate 17 minus 2. Oh, that's 15. So now the equation is 3x = 15. Now, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 3 because 3 is multiplied by x. Dividing both sides by 3 would give me x = 15 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, x equals 5. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 3x + 2 = 17. Subtract 2: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5. Yeah, that seems right. Let me plug the value back into the original equation to verify. If x is 5, then 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 is 17. Yep, that matches the original equation. So, x equals 5. \n\nI think that's all. No steps missed here. Just basic algebra operations. So the answer should be 5.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation $ 3x + 2 = 17 $, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate $ x $**: Subtract 2 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side.  \n   $$\n   3x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2 \\implies 3x = 15\n   $$\n\n2. **Solve for $ x $**: Divide both sides by 3 to isolate $ x $.  \n   $$\n   x = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n   $$\n\n3. **Verify the solution**: Substitute $ x = 5 $ back into the original equation to ensure it holds true.  \n   $$\n   3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17\n   $$\n\n**Final Answer**: $ x = 5 $"

    "input": "What is the square root of 144?",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the square root of 144. Let me think. First, I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, if I take the square root of 144, I should get a number that, when squared, equals 144. \n\nLet me start by recalling some basic facts. For example, 10 squared is 100, and 12 squared is 144. Wait, so 12 multiplied by 12 is 144. That means the square root of 144 should be 12. But let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Maybe there are other numbers that when squared give 144? Let me check.\n\nIf I think of the square of 144, that's 144 times 144. But no, the square root is not the same as multiplying. The square root is the inverse operation. So, if I take 12 squared, it's 144, so 12 is the square root. But maybe there are other numbers? For example, negative numbers? Well, square roots are defined to be non-negative in real numbers. So even though -12 squared is 144, we usually write the square root as 12. \n\nLet me verify this with another approach. Maybe using the definition of square root. If I have a number x, then x\u00b2 = 144. So solving for x, I get x = \u00b1\u221a144. But since we are talking about the square root, which is usually considered as the principal root, which is the non-negative one, then yes, x = 12. \n\nIs there any chance that I made a mistake in my calculation? Let me double-check. 12 times 12. 10 times 12 is 120, and 2 times 12 is 24, so adding those together gives 144. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is factoring the number. Let's see, 144. If I break it down into prime factors, 144 is 16 times 9, and 16 is 2^4, and 9 is 3^2. So 2^4 times 3^2. Then the square root would be taking each prime factor to the 1/2 power. So for 2^4, that's 2^(4/2) = 2^2, and for 3^2, that's 3^(2/2) = 3^1. Multiplying these together, 2^2 * 3^1 = 4 * 3 = 12. So that also gives 12. \n\nWait, so all these methods lead me to the same answer. So maybe I'm just overcomplicating it? It seems straightforward. Maybe there's a common misconception here? Like, some students might think that the square root of 144 is 12, so they just write that. But I need to explain each step clearly for a class 8 student. So, step by step, how would I explain this?\n\nFirst, define the square root as a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. Then, for 144, find a number that, when squared, equals 144. \n\nNext, break down 144 into its prime factors. 144 = 16 * 9 = (2^4) * (3^2). Then, taking the square root would be taking each prime factor to 1/2 power. So 2^(4/2) is 2^2, which is 4, and 3^(2/2) is 3^1, which is 3. Multiplying those gives 4 * 3 = 12. \n\nAlternatively, think of 144 as a product of numbers. 144 divided by 2 is 72, and 72 divided by 2 is 36, divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 is 9. So that's 2^4 * 9. Then, taking the square root again would be dividing each exponent by 2: 2^(4/2) * 9^(1/2) = 2^2 * 3^(1) = 12. \n\nAnother way is to recognize that 144 is 12 squared, so the square root is 12. Maybe I can also use the definition of square root in terms of solving for x in x\u00b2 = 144. If I take x = 12, then 12\u00b2 = 144. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, is there any possibility that 12 is not the only solution? For example, if I consider negative numbers, but square roots are typically considered as non-negative. So even though -12 squared is 144, the principal square root is 12. \n\nSo, to wrap up, the square root of 144 is 12, and I can explain each step clearly by breaking it down into prime factors, prime factorization, or by recognizing that 12 squared is 144. That should cover it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the square root of 144, we begin by understanding the concept of a square root. The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, results in the original number. In this case, we want to find a number $ x $ such that $ x^2 = 144 $.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:  \n   Break down 144 into its prime factors.  \n   $ 144 = 16 \\times 9 = (2^4) \\times (3^2) $.  \n   When taking the square root, we apply the same exponent to each prime factor.  \n   $ \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2} = (2^4)^{1/2} \\times (3^2)^{1/2} = 2^2 \\times 3^{1} = 12 $.\n\n2. **Recognizing the Pattern**:  \n   Since $ 12^2 = 144 $, we can directly conclude that the square root of 144 is 12.\n\n3. **Principal Root**:  \n   In mathematics, the square root of a number is defined as the principal (non-negative) root. While $ -12 $ also satisfies $ (-12)^2 = 144 $, the convention in algebra and math education typically refers to the principal root, which is 12.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe square root of 144 is $ \\boxed{12} $."

    "input": "Simplify: (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the expression (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when you have a polynomial divided by another, you can try factoring the numerator to see if there's a common factor with the denominator. The numerator is x\u00b2 minus 9, which looks like a difference of squares. Right, because a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 factors into (a - b)(a + b). Let me write that down:\n\nx\u00b2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\n\nOh, wait! The denominator is (x - 3). So if I substitute that back in, the expression becomes:\n\n(x - 3)(x + 3) divided by (x - 3)\n\nHmm, so now I can cancel out the common factor (x - 3) from the numerator and the denominator. That should simplify things. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me check my factoring again. If I expand (x - 3)(x + 3), does it equal x\u00b2 - 9? Let me do that:\n\nMultiply x by (x + 3): x\u00b2 + 3x\n\nMultiply -3 by (x + 3): -3x - 9\n\nAdding them together: x\u00b2 + 3x - 3x - 9 = x\u00b2 - 9. Yes, that's correct. So the factoring is right.\n\nSo then, cancelling (x - 3) gives me (x + 3). But wait, does that mean the simplified expression is just (x + 3)? Let me think again. So originally, we had (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3), and after factoring, it's (x - 3)(x + 3)/(x - 3). So if x \u2260 3 (since we had a denominator), we can divide both numerator and denominator by (x - 3), resulting in x + 3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other step I need to consider. For example, if x equals 3, then the original expression would be undefined because dividing by zero. But in the simplified expression, we canceled out (x - 3), so we don't have to worry about that in the simplified form. Therefore, the simplified form is x + 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there are no other factors. Let me think again. The original expression is (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). The numerator is a difference of squares, so factoring gives (x - 3)(x + 3). The denominator is (x - 3), so we can cancel those. So yes, simplifying gives x + 3. That seems right.\n\nIs there any possibility that I made a mistake in the factoring? Let me try expanding (x - 3)(x + 3) again. As I did before, x\u00b2 + 3x - 3x - 9 = x\u00b2 - 9. Correct. So that's a correct factoring.\n\nTherefore, the simplified expression is x + 3. So the answer is x + 3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me test with a specific value. Let's pick a value for x, say x = 4. Then original expression: (16 - 9)/ (4 - 3) = 7/1 = 7. And simplified expression is (4 + 3) = 7. Perfect, matches. Another test: x = 2. Original: (4 - 9)/ (2 - 3) = (-5)/(-1) = 5. Simplified: (2 + 3) = 5. Correct again. What if x = 3? Wait, x = 3 makes the denominator zero, so it's undefined. So that's excluded. So all tests work out. Therefore, I can be confident that the simplified expression is x + 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe simplified form of the expression is \\boxed{x + 3}.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression $(x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)$, let's proceed step by step, starting with the algebraic manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recognize the Structure\n\nThe given expression is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}\n$$\n\nWe notice that the numerator $x^2 - 9$ is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\n$$\n\nThis is a useful factoring step, and now we can write the expression as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Cancel Common Factors\n\nNow, we observe that both the numerator and the denominator have a common factor of $(x - 3)$. Since division by zero is undefined, we can cancel out the $(x - 3)$ term from the numerator and the denominator, provided $x \\neq 3$.\n\nAfter canceling, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\nx + 3\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the expression is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x + 3}\n$$"

    "input": "Solve: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation x squared plus 5x plus 6 equals zero. Let me think. First, I remember that quadratic equations can be solved in a few ways. The standard methods are factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me see if I can factor this equation.\n\nThe equation is x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0. To factor it, I need two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of x). Let me think... factors of 6 are 1 and 6, 2 and 3. Let me check: 1 + 6 is 7, which isn't 5. 2 + 3 is 5. Perfect! So, the equation can be factored as (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0.\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero gives me the solutions. So, x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0. Solving these, x = -2 or x = -3. Let me check if these values actually work in the original equation. Plugging x = -2 into the equation: (-2)\u00b2 + 5*(-2) + 6 = 4 -10 +6 = 0. That works. Similarly, for x = -3: (-3)\u00b2 + 5*(-3) +6 = 9 -15 +6 = 0. Yep, that also works. So both solutions are correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in factoring. Let me double-check. Multiply (x + 2)(x + 3) = x\u00b2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x\u00b2 + 5x + 6. Perfect, that matches. So, all steps seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I weren't able to factor it, I could use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a = 1, b = 5, c = 6. Plugging in, we get x = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2 = [-5 \u00b1 sqrt(1)] / 2. Since sqrt(1) is 1, this simplifies to x = [-5 \u00b1 1]/2. So, two solutions: (-5 + 1)/2 = -4/2 = -2, and (-5 - 1)/2 = -6/2 = -3. Same results as before. So regardless of the method, I get x = -2 and x = -3. Good to know that both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nI think that's it. The solutions are straightforward once I recognize the factors. Let me just recap: factoring the quadratic, setting each factor to zero, solving, and verifying. All steps make sense. No mistakes detected. So the final answer is x equals negative two or negative three.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solutions are \\boxed{-2} and \\boxed{-3}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $, we can follow a systematic process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Quadratic Expression\n\nWe are given:\n$$\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\n$$\n\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add to 5 (the coefficient of $ x $).
