    "input": "Solve: (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation (2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a product of two expressions equal to zero, that means either one of the expressions is zero individually. So maybe I can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x? Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the first factor: 2x + 3 = 0. To solve for x, I can subtract 3 from both sides. So, 2x = -3. Then divide both sides by 2, which gives x = -3/2. That simplifies to x = -1.5 or -1.5. \n\nNow the second factor: x - 5 = 0. Solving for x, I can add 5 to both sides, resulting in x = 5. \n\nSo, the solutions should be x = -1.5 and x = 5. Wait, let me check if that's correct. Plugging x = -1.5 back into the original equation: (2*(-1.5) + 3)*( -1.5 - 5 ) = (-3 + 3)*(-6.5) = (0)*(-6.5) = 0. That works. \n\nFor x = 5: (2*5 + 3)*(5 - 5) = (10 + 3)*(0) = 13*0 = 0. Also works. \n\nSo both solutions satisfy the equation. Are there any other possibilities? Well, since it's a quadratic equation, there should be two solutions, which are x = -1.5 and x = 5. \n\nWait, but maybe I should write them as fractions instead of decimals? -3/2 is -1.5, so that's fine. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in my calculations? Let me verify again. For 2x + 3 = 0: x = -3/2. Correct. For x - 5 = 0: x = 5. Correct. Multiplying back in, it checks out. \n\nSo the final answer should be x = -3/2 and x = 5. But maybe I should write them as fractions. Let me see, yes, -3/2 is already a fraction. So the solutions are x equals negative three over two and five. \n\nI think that's all. No other steps needed here. The problem is straightforward once I recognize that factoring a quadratic equation gives two solutions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation $(2x + 3)(x - 5) = 0$, we can apply the **zero product property**, which states that if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Set Each Factor Equal to Zero\n\n1. Set $2x + 3 = 0$:\n   $$\n   2x + 3 = 0 \\implies 2x = -3 \\implies x = -\\frac{3}{2}\n   $$\n\n2. Set $x - 5 = 0$:\n   $$\n   x - 5 = 0 \\implies x = 5\n   $$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Solutions\n\n- **For $x = -\\frac{3}{2}$:**\n  $$\n  (2x + 3)(x - 5) = (2(-\\frac{3}{2}) + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = (-3 + 3)(-\\frac{3}{2} - 5) = (0)(-6.5) = 0\n  $$\n  \u2705 This solution satisfies the original equation.\n\n- **For $x = 5$:**\n  $$\n  (2x + 3)(x - 5) = (10 + 3)(5 - 5) = 13 \\cdot 0 = 0\n  $$\n  \u2705 This solution also satisfies the original equation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x = -\\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } x = 5}\n$$"

    "input": "Find the value of x: 3x + 2 = 17",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the equation 3x plus 2 equals 17. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. That means I need to undo the operations that are happening to x. \n\nThe equation is 3x + 2 = 17. So, there's a 3 multiplied by x and then we have a +2. To isolate x, I should first subtract 2 from both sides so that I can get rid of that 2. Let me do that. If I subtract 2 from both sides, the equation becomes 3x = 17 minus 2. What's 17 minus 2? That should be 15. So now the equation is 3x = 15. \n\nNow, to get x by itself, I need to divide both sides by 3. Dividing both sides by 3 would give me x equals 15 divided by 3. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So, x equals 5. \n\nWait, let me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Plugging x = 5 back into the original equation: 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 gives 17. Yep, that matches the right side of the equation. So, my answer should be correct. \n\nI think that's all there is to it. There's only one step here, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in the calculations. Let me go through it again step by step to be thorough. \n\nOriginal equation: 3x + 2 = 17. Subtract 2: 3x = 17 - 2 = 15. Divide by 3: x = 15 / 3 = 5. Yep, that's correct. \n\nNo, I don't think there's any error here. The process is straightforward, and the final answer checks out.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation $3x + 2 = 17$, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtract 2 from both sides** to isolate the term with $x$:\n   $$\n   3x + 2 - 2 = 17 - 2\n   $$\n   Simplifying:\n   $$\n   3x = 15\n   $$\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 3** to solve for $x$:\n   $$\n   x = \\frac{15}{3}\n   $$\n\n3. **Simplify**:\n   $$\n   x = 5\n   $$\n\n**Verification**: Substitute $x = 5$ back into the original equation:\n$$\n3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17\n$$\nThe equation holds true, confirming the solution.\n\n**Final Answer**: $x = 5$"

    "input": "What is the square root of 144?",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the square root of 144. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. First, I remember that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, the square root of 144 should be a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 144.\n\nLet me start by recalling some basic facts. For example, 12 squared is 144, right? Because 12 times 12 is 144. Wait, so does that mean the square root of 144 is 12? That seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should break down the number into prime factors to verify. Let's see, 144. Dividing by 2 repeatedly: 144 \u00f7 2 = 72, then 72 \u00f7 2 = 36, then 36 \u00f7 2 = 18, then 18 \u00f7 2 = 9. So, that's 2 multiplied by itself four times, which is 2^4. Then, 9 is 3 squared. So, combining them, 144 is 2^4 \u00d7 3^2. \n\nIf I take the square root of both sides, then \u221a(2^4 \u00d7 3^2) should be equal to \u221a(2^4) \u00d7 \u221a(3^2). Which is 2^2 \u00d7 3, which is 4 \u00d7 3. And 4 times 3 is 12. So that confirms it again. So the square root of 144 is 12.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to think about this. For instance, using a calculator or another method. But since I'm just solving it step by step, I can't use a calculator. However, I can think about the properties of square roots. For example, the square root function is defined to be non-negative, so even if 144 is a perfect square, its square root is a positive number.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the square root of a number is the same as the number raised to the power of 1/2. So, 144^(1/2) equals... Well, 12^(1/2) is the same as 12, so yeah, that's 12.\n\nIs there any chance I could have made a mistake here? Let me check. Suppose someone thinks 144 is a square of 10 or something else. But 10 squared is 100, which is smaller. 12 squared is 144, and 13 squared is 169. So definitely, 12 is the correct square root.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and verifications, I can confidently say that the square root of 144 is 12.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the square root of 144, we begin by recognizing that the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, results in the original number. In this case, we are looking for a number $ x $ such that:\n\n$$\nx^2 = 144\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify a known square:**  \n   We note that $ 12 \\times 12 = 144 $, so $ 12^2 = 144 $. This directly shows that the square root of 144 is 12.\n\n2. **Verify using prime factorization:**  \n   Express 144 in terms of prime factors:  \n   $$\n   144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2\n   $$\n   Taking the square root of both sides:\n   $$\n   \\sqrt{144} = \\sqrt{2^4 \\times 3^2} = 2^2 \\times 3 = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   $$\n\n3. **Check for alternative interpretations:**  \n   While $ \\sqrt{144} $ can also be interpreted as $ 144^{1/2} $, this leads to the same result. Furthermore, verifying using known square numbers confirms that $ 12 $ is the correct value.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{12}\n$$"

    "input": "Simplify: (x^2 - 9)/(x - 3)",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the expression (x\u00b2 - 9)/(x - 3). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that when you have a rational expression like this, you can try factoring the numerator and the denominator to see if there's a common factor that can cancel out.\n\nLooking at the numerator, x\u00b2 - 9. Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. The formula for a difference of squares is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). So applying that here, x\u00b2 - 9 would be (x - 3)(x + 3). That simplifies the numerator!\n\nNow the original expression becomes (x - 3)(x + 3)/(x - 3). Oh, so now there's a common factor of (x - 3) in both the numerator and the denominator. I can cancel that out, right? So that would leave me with (x + 3). \n\nWait, but hold on, I should check if there are any restrictions on the value of x because we're dividing by (x - 3). The original problem doesn't specify any domain restrictions, so I guess we don't need to worry about that here. The expression is defined for all real numbers except x = 3, since division by zero would be undefined.\n\nSo putting it all together, the simplified expression is (x + 3). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Factoring the numerator correctly gives me (x - 3)(x + 3). Then canceling (x - 3) from numerator and denominator gives me x + 3. Yep, that seems right.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using polynomial long division? Let me try that. Dividing x\u00b2 - 9 by x - 3. \n\nDivide x\u00b2 by x to get x. Multiply (x - 3) by x to get x\u00b2 - 3x. Subtract that from the original polynomial (x\u00b2 - 9): (x\u00b2 - 9) - (x\u00b2 - 3x) = 0 + 3x - 9. Then bring down the terms, but there are no more terms. So the remainder is 3x - 9, and the divisor is x - 3. So the simplified form would be x + 3 with a remainder of 3x - 9. But wait, this is a remainder, so technically, the expression can't be simplified further. But in most cases, they want you to cancel the common factor, so the simplified form is x + 3. \n\nSo even with polynomial division, we end up with the same result. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct, and the simplified expression is x + 3. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Both factoring and polynomial division lead me to the same conclusion. So I'm confident that the simplified form is (x + 3).\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression $\\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}$, we begin by identifying and factoring both the numerator and the denominator.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Numerator\n\nThe numerator is $x^2 - 9$. Recognizing this as a difference of squares, we apply the identity:\n\n$$\na^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\n$$\n\nHere, $a = x$ and $b = 3$. Applying the identity:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Expression\n\nSubstitute the factored form of the numerator into the original expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{x - 3}\n$$\n\nNow, we can cancel the common factor $(x - 3)$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(x - 3)(x + 3)}{(x - 3)} = x + 3\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider Domain Restrictions\n\nThe original expression is defined for all real numbers except $x = 3$, since the denominator becomes zero at this point. Thus, $x + 3$ is valid for all real numbers except $x = 3$.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{x + 3}\n$$"

    "input": "Solve: x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0",
    "output": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the quadratic equation x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0. Let me think about how to approach this. First, I remember that quadratic equations can be solved by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me check if this equation can be factored easily.\n\nLooking at the equation x\u00b2 + 5x + 6, I need two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the x term). Let me list the factors of 6: 1 and 6, 2 and 3. Adding 2 and 3 gives 5, which matches the coefficient. So, that means the equation can be factored as (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0. \n\nNow, applying the zero product property, if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. So, either x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0. Solving these, I get x = -2 or x = -3. \n\nWait, let me double-check by plugging these values back into the original equation to make sure. Let's take x = -2: (-2)\u00b2 + 5*(-2) + 6 = 4 -10 +6 = 0. Correct. Now x = -3: (-3)\u00b2 + 5*(-3) +6 = 9 -15 +6 = 0. Perfect, both values work. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't factor it, I could use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a), where a = 1, b = 5, c = 6. Plugging in, we get x = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 - 24)] / 2 = [-5 \u00b1 \u221a1]/2 = [-5 \u00b1 1]/2. So, the solutions are (-5 + 1)/2 = -4/2 = -2, and (-5 -1)/2 = -6/2 = -3. Same results as before. \n\nSo, regardless of the method, the solutions are x = -2 and x = -3. I think that's it. No mistakes in my reasoning, both factoring and quadratic formula lead to the same answers. I'm confident this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the quadratic equation $ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 $, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Factor the Equation\nWe look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3. Therefore, the equation can be factored as:\n\n$$\nx^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Zero Product Property\nIf the product of two binomials is zero, at least one of the binomials must be zero. So, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\n$$\nx + 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 3 = 0\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Equations\nSolving these:\n\n$$\nx = -2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solutions\nTo ensure the solutions are correct, substitute them back into the original equation:\n\n- For $ x = -2 $: $ (-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 $\n- For $ x = -3 $: $ (-3)^2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 $\n\nBoth values satisfy the equation, confirming the correctness of the solutions.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{-2 \\text{ and } -3}\n$$"
